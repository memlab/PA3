  In this experiment you will study lists of 
  word pairs presented on the screen. First you
  will see a row of X's (XXXXXXX), then the pair
  will be presented.

  Following the presentation of the pairs you will
  be presented with a series of question marks 
  (??????) and then one word from the list, either 
  the first or second word, and asked to recall 
  the matching word from the pair. Please speak 
  your response into the microphone.  If you cannot 
  remember the word, say "pass". After you say the
  word or "pass", hit the space bar to proceed to
  the next word.
 
  You will begin with one practice round, which will 
  allow you to become familiar with the task.
 
  If you have any questions about these instructions, 
  ask the experimenter now.
