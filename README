1. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

The PA2 experiment was designed to be used specifically during
electrophysiological recordings. This experiment uses interference
versus no interference, forward versus backward recall, and item
versus associative encoding to try and elicit differences in brain
activation.


2. RUNNING PA2

*********
PA3 Update: looking at old data on rhino it appears both the easy
and regular lists have been used in the past. For example:
/data1/eeg/group2/BW002/behavioral/pa2/data/21/subdat.csv
/data1/eeg/group2/BW002/behavioral/pa2/data/22/subdat.csv
*********

First check to see that the appropriate links for your language are 
made in the txt/ directory. For example, if running in Germany, 
'nounpool.txt' should be a link to 'nounpool_german.txt', and 'intro.txt'
should be linked to 'intro_german.txt'. Once the proper links have been 
configured, make sure that 'config.ini' has the configuration you desire.

Then type,

   pythonw pypa2.py -s SUBJECT_ID

and enter the subject identifier in place of SUBJECT_ID. You may quit 
the experiment between trials by pressing the ESC-F1 keys together. 
The experimenter is required to hit a key after each subject response 
to proceed to the next trial.


3. SCORING THE DATA

  pythonw pypa2_score.py -s SUBJECT_ID

then enter subject number at the prompt. A correct response can be
recorded by entering the 'Y' key.  The program will also recognize the
word 'P' for pass, 'N' for no (or incorrect), and 'M' for near miss.  
To listen to the response again, press the <enter> key.


4. ANALYSIS

  pythonw pypa2_save.py -s SUBJECT_ID

The behavioral results of the experiment are contained within the 
subdat.csv file. 

The EEG results can can be found in 
data/SUBJECT_ID/session_RUN/eeg.eeglog and 
data/SUBJECT_ID/session_RUN/session.log .

The analyze_subject.m script can be run from within matlab to assess
the performance of an individual subject. This script is well
documented.
