- Six pairs per trial
- Instructions are only given once, before the first trial.
- In a stim trial you should ask after if you want to resync.
- In a no-stim trial you should do the normal once per second syncing throughout trial. No questions asked.
- Words are up for 1600ms +/- 200, and down for 800ms +/- 200.
- In a stim trial stimulate for the complete up & down period for the word.
- Shuffle the noun list. Ideally control that pairs have very dissimilar semantics.
- For recall, give 2500ms during which recording, and possibly stimulating. Then 800 down no recording or stimming.
- In a stim trial randomize whether to stim the odd or even words.
- Log frequency, amplitude current. Put those vars in config.py.
